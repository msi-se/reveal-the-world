        <h1>Welcome to <b>Reveal the World!</b></h1>

        <p>Reveal the World is a platform to visualize your travels. You can mark the places you have already visited on a world map and color in regions. Like with an analog scratch map -- just cooler!</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can also check the heatmap to see which regions of the world are particularly frequently visited.</p>
